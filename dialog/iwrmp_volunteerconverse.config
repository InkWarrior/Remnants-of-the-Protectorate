                "Inspired. I've heard many positive things about the Protectorate, so I felt compelled to help them out when they've been needing it the most.",
                "Thoughtful. I don't think this is how I intended to join the Protectorate. Not that I'm complaining.",
                "Moved. Don't you think how wonderful it is to see all these people helping each other out?",
                "Surprised. My friend and I went to sign up for the Volunteer Program. I haven't seen them lately but that's alright!",
                "Decided. I stopped being a farmer for a space company, so when I saw the Volunteer program, I decided to sign up.",
                "Confused. Since there is no reward for this job, I can't tell why I joined in, I just did because I could.",
                "Inspired. Many within my village saw what happened to Earth and decided to join as volunteers, we all felt moved enough to help.",
                "Cheerful. This is the closest I'll ever be to being a Protector.",
                "Motivated. Since everybody else was helping out, I had to ask myself \"are you going to sit there and do nothing?\".",
                "Confident. I have done volunteer work before, so I'm not really out of my league here.",

                "Informative. I heard the Protectorate needed mechanics, so I figured my skills could be helpful.",
                "Informative. I heard the Protectorate needed a chef, I knew my days grilling hamburgers would finally pay off!",
                "Informative. I heard the Protectorate needed a tailor, seems their uniforms get torn very often.",
                "Informative. I heard the Protectorate needed a engineer, turns out I'm very good with computers.",
                "Informative. I heard the Protectorate needed help, so I guessed that I could actually do something to help!",
                "Thoughtful. Not everyone has the time or the energy to be volunteers, but there are always ways to help out.",
                "Exhausted. I've been doing a ton of work recently, I'm tired, but I'm not complaining.",
                "Tired. I do need a bit of rest, I've been working nonstop!",
                "Happy. I'm glad that I can be somewhat helpful.",
                "Motivated. Helping the Protectorate is an opportunity I just couldn't pass up.",

                "Amazed. This week alone I have been to more places than ever in my life!",
                "Wonderstruck. The amount of planets I've been seeing so far beats any previous record I had, which was admittedly rather low.",
                "Anxious. I have taken so many souvenirs of different places, where am I even going to put them!?",
                "Eager. Now I know I'm not on a field trip, but to me it kind of feels like one.",
                "Concerned. I knew I was going to go far from home in this line of work, I hope the Protectorate can at least take me back there when all is over.",
                "Impressed. Visiting hundreds of planets wasn't mentioned in the initiative at all! Well, I suppose it was actually.",
                "Excited. Traveling so much makes me understand why Envoys do it, it's really exciting!",
                "Amazed. Before being a Volunteer I've only been to, like, two planets, now I've seen a dozen more!",
                "Embarrassed. I don't want to undermine the seriousness of the situation here, but this has been an amazing experience so far.",
                "Astounded. How many opportunities in life do you get, to travel to hundreds of planets? Almost never!",

                "Somber. I've heard a lot of things about Earth, and the only thing I'm certain of is that is gone.",
                "Curious. Were you on Earth when it got destroyed?",
                "Despondent. It's still difficult to think the Protectorate is close to disappearing.",
                "Bewildered. The destruction of the Protectorate was just so sudden! I'm still processing it.",
                "Perplexed. It's hard to grasp that the Protectorate is at the edge of vanishing.",
                "Disheartened. I don't think I've ever been to Earth. It's a shame I will never go.",
                "Nostalgic. My family and I went once to Earth, truly a mesmerizing place.",
                "Curious. Is Earth just as amazing as everyone has told me?",
                "Thoughtful. Well, in retrospect, having all of the Protectorate in one place was not really a good idea, you know?",
                "Concerned. I'm actually surprised the Protectorate wasn't as decentralized as I thought it would be.",

                "Nervous. Of course I feel the pressure of not letting the Protectorate fall, I prefer to not be reminded of that though.",
                "Confident. I'm not sure about everyone else, but I think at least we are making good progress here.",
                "Uplifted. I have already invited some of my friends so they can sign up and help the Protectorate.",
                "Nostalgic. I kind of miss home, but I know I will go back eventually.",
                "Surprised. The amount of people I've gotten to know is quite a lot, I'm really impressed.",
                "Pleased. I didn't know that the Protectorate had education programs for the Florans, I wonder if the Glitch are the main ones helping with it.",
                "Cheerful. I wish the Grounded good luck! I recently learned about their struggles, I can only hope they can achieve a life full of freedom.",
                "Solidary. I never knew about the struggle of Grounded against the Stargazers, now I don't like Stargazers so much!",
                "Respectful. My respect to the Apex rebels, their life is dire yet they are determined to keep on going.",
                "Disdainful. I've heard few things about the Miniknog before, but now that I know more, I certainly don't like them!",
                "Cheerful. Best wishes to all of the self-aware Glitch out there, I know we will achieve peaceful lives!",
                "Confused. I'm disoriented as to why many races think all of the Glitch are self-aware, I would definitely like it to be that way!",
                "Cheerful. Best of luck to all the people out there! Times are turbulent, but I'm sure we'll make it through.",
                "Disheartened. There's been a lot of people fleeing and moving from their home because of the present circumstances.",
                "Irritated. Unfortunately, a lot of bad actors are using this moment to torment helpless communities! That's not good!",

                "Decided. I don't think I ever thought of being a Protector, but now, if I ever get the chance, I want to become one.",
                "Thoughtful. It never crossed my mind, being a Protector, at least not until now.",
                "Inspired. I'm not sure if I can ever be a Protector, but I would definitely want to be one.",
                "Uplifted. My time being a volunteer made me realize that I would actually like to be a Protector.",
                "Embarrassed. Now that I'm a volunteer I realize I'm just fine sticking with volunteering.",
                "Undecided. I'm not sure if I ever could be a Protector, the volunteer experience is already tiring!",
