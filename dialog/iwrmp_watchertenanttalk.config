		"My Watcher training always delivers, do not take me lightly.",
		"Were you a Protector? I always envied the more light training you guys had to go through.",
		"I wish I could be an Envoy Frontiersman. I would still be bored, yes, but I'd be going to uncharted places at least.",
		"I must say, this place is quite relaxing, I don't have to stress myself a lot thanks to that.",
