                "I'm not sure about contracting ex-outlaws, but hey, I guess everybody deserves a second chance.",

                "Our fleet is scattered throughout the galaxy just like before, but instead of exploring we are helping people.",

                "I'm sure some of our own space stations are currently abandoned. How many I can't tell.",
                "Can you believe it? We, the 21st Astraeus Fleet, now doing Protectorate chores, never crossed my mind.",
                "I'm worried about our Protector friends, I'm sure most of them are just demoralized.",
