                "Doubtful. Do you think it's still worth it? The Protectorate I mean.",
                "Lost. Maybe I will retire, everything's just fallen apart, and I don't know what to do.",
                "Confused. Should I just go and retire? I can leave this life behind, but I'm not sure yet if I want to.",
                "Despondent. Things are going to get worse, aren't they?",

                "Thoughtful. What would the Chief Commander do if she was in my place?",
                "Happy. Look on the bright side, there's going to be less paperwork!",
                "Concerned. Is this a bad time to be thinking about opening a new Protectorate academy?",
                "Frustrated. And just when I was thinking of visiting Earth, it gets blown up!",

                "Curious. You ever went to Earth? It was quite impressive.",
                "Nostalgic. I did my training back on Earth, such a busy place!",
                "Evocative. I got to see Earth in my days at the academy, a very interesting place if you ask me.",
                "Yearning. I've been remembering my days as a cadet on Earth lately.",
                "Evocative. Earth had a menagerie of cultures, definitely one of the most impressive places in the galaxy.",
                "Blurry. The academy was at one of the largest cities on Earth if I remember. Funny thing, I don't remember its name. I think it started with the letter \"L\"?",
                "Mournful. I'm not from Earth, yet I pretty much considered it a second home. It's a real bummer it's gone now.",
                "Explicative. Earth tended to be very overwhelming on it's own, I knew many cadets that dropped out because of that alone.",
                "Longing. Yeah, I was from Earth. Such a unique place in the galaxy.",
                "Annoyed. Humans never got to open colonies off-Earth, and now that's come back to bite them in their ankles.",

                "Persuasive. We opened a Volunteer program, we really need help.",
                "Informative. Have you heard of the Volunteer initiative yet? We are looking for help.",
                "Stressed. Right now we need more help than ever.",
                "Persuasive. If you are interested in helping us, you can join our Volunteer program.",
                "Curious. If you know someone who wants to help us, you can tell them about our Volunteer program.",
                "Informative. We need more mechanics and engineers, our ships are starting to falter.",
                "Informative. We need more tailors, you would not believe the amount of times our uniforms get torn.",
                "Informative. We need more medics and cooks, we need to take care of a lot of refugees right now.",
                "Informative. We need more janitors, you can't believe how much health can depend a lot of a clean environments alone.",
                "Concerned. I'm not so sure about contracting ex-outlaws, but hey, I guess everybody deserves a second chance.",

                "Explicative. Our fleet is scattered throughout the galaxy just like before, but now we are helping people.",
                "Concerned. We weren't exactly stocked up on supplies when returning back to Earth, so we are depending a lot on donations.",
                "Anxious. Some of our crew has been tasked with scavenging useful stuff, especially Erchius fuel, things are that bad!",
                "Motivated. I'm glad a lot of people are helping with supply donations, those are what keeping us going!",
                "Concerned. Our ships were made to last, but even they can get worn and require repairs.",
                "Preoccupied. Of all the things we need, Erchius fuel is currently the one we need the most.",
                "Perplexed. We've been registering attacks from the Occasus. I can't really tell why that is.",
                "Upset. So far pirates have been leaving us alone, but the Occasus have been wrecking some of our ships.",
                "Worried. There are a lot of abandoned Protectorate stations right now, and we really need to find them all.",

                "Concerned. I've heard pirate activity has increased since the Peacekeepers went radio silent.",
                "Reassuring. Pirates are getting a bit bolder than usual, don't let them scare you.",
                "Helpful. Pirate activity is increasing out there, you should move carefully.",
                "Indignant. As expected, many Apex settlements we watched over are getting harassed by the Miniknog now.",
                "Annoyed. The Miniknog is now on the move looking for, well, \"rebels\" in some of the settlements we watched over.",
                "Stressed. We have received panic calls from many Grounded Avian villages, they fear the Stargazers could retaliate.",

                "Mocking. Don't believe Occasus propaganda, I bet they don't even believe it themselves.",

                "Informative. I've heard there are negotiations with Letheia to use more of their space stations.",
                "Explicative. I'm sure some of our own space stations are currently abandoned. How many, I can't tell.",
                "Incredulous. Can you believe it? The 21st Astraeus Fleet is now doing regular Protectorate chores, never even though that was possible.",
                "Preoccupied. I'm worried about our Protector friends, I'm sure most of them are rather demoralized.",
                "Uplifted. I wish the best regards for my Protector peers, they are doing their best with what little they now have.",
                "Relieved. Thankfully, we have received support from many people out there.",
