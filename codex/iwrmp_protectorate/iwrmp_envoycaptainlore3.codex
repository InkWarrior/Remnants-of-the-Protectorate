  "^yellow;Log Entry #364, Year 9 - Astraeus Mission XXI^reset;
  
It's New Year! We threw a little celebration with the whole crew, Rimu as always is an amazing cook. Everything is also ready for our return to Earth, just a year of travel! Adam and I have a lot of plans of what to do once we return to Earth; taking a well-deserved rest for one, we are not exactly young anymore haha. Anyhow, that's all I have to report for today! Captain out.",

"^yellow;Log Entry #364, Year 10 - Astraeus Mission XXI^reset;

A bit closer to Earth now! Just another half a year of travel and we should be received by the biggest celebration ever made! All the crew is buzzing with plans and expectations. Adam and I decided that we'll move to a cozy field and just have our house close to one of those quieter towns, after a life of adventures the least we could have is a peaceful life. I'm not exactly fond of the countryside but I'm be open to the idea.",

"^yellow;Log Entry #190 - Days after Earth's incident^reset;

We were in disbelief for a while. We thought it was a prank, but then the days passed, and reports kept coming. Yesterday, for the first time, we cried. Many of us were expecting to see our families and Adam is feeling desperate, I tried to stay calm with the crew, but I cried too. I haven't cried in years, I forgot the sound of my own sadness. We are just waiting for news now, and new orders perhaps.",

"^yellow;Log Entry #209^reset;

I guess our plans for a good rest will wait. We received orders to help a Protectorate outpost in the Hind Formation system. The crew seems to have regained some of their optimism, seems our new work keeps them distracted. We are still sad, but the fact that many of us are still here seems to be good motivation to keep going on. Hmm, I haven't though about it, but Adam and I could live on another planet. I'm looking forward to that idea. Captain out."
