  "This is Chief Commander Obinata speaking from the AES Argonaut to all remnants of the Terrene Protectorate.//
We must begin our reorganization efforts. Our current objective is to reestablish the Protectorate Network close to it's original capacity; Divisions 10, 11, 12 and 13 must locate and restore any abandoned space stations they find; all Protectors from small outposts shall move to the closest station in their area.//",

"Divisions 6, 7, 8, and 9 will have to reestablish supply routes, any remaining Protectorate ships must integrate into these supply routes too.//
Divisions 14, 15, 16 and 17 must respond to distress calls and check in on all settlements the Protectorate has previously overseen. If necessary, new encampments will be established for refugees and displaced settlers.//",

"Last but not least, all Artificial Biospheres will be assigned extra duties, most of them may need to be converted into outposts and encampments for refugees if necessary.//
The rest of the Fleet will be in standby to support in all of these, and further, directives. Chief Commander Obinata out.//"
