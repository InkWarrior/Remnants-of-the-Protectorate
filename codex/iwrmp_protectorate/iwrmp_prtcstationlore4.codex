  "This is Chief Commander Obinata speaking from the AES Argonaut to all remnants of the Terrene Protectorate.//
We must start with the reorganization efforts. Our current objective is to reestablish the Protectorate Network close to it's full capacity; Divisions 10, 11, 12 and 13 must locate and restore any abandoned space station; all Protectors from small outposts shall move to the closest station in your area.//",

"Divisions 6, 7, 8, and 9 will have to reestablish supply routes, any remaining Protectorate ships must integrate into these supply routes too.//
Divisions 14, 15, 16 and 17 must respond to distress calls and check any settlement the Protectorate oversaw. If necessary, new encampments must be stablished for refugees and displaced settlements.//",

"Last but not least, all Artificial Biospheres will be assigned with extra functions, most of them will turn into outposts and encampments for refugees if necessary.//
The rest of the Fleets will be in standby for support in any of these and further directives. Chief Commander Obinata out.//"
