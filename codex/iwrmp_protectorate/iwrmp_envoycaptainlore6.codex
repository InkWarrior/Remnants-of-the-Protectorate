Oh my! We found the biggest mountain in the galaxy, I think! It's huge! We could see it from the exosphere of the planet, I think it's quite a feat of nature. Someone suggested to call it Josh, I don't get why but it sure sounds funny. Anyway, it certainly goes on my list of things I would like to remember!",

There are stories of unknown ships in space, sometimes there are talks of ship debris that belonged to who-knows-what as well. We found a sort of ship graveyard on a volcanic planet recently. The ships were incredibly old, and they were pretty much toasted by the environment. Another curiosity for the list, I guess!",

Have you ever seen a subterranean liquid erchius waterfall? Well, I just did! We had a little problem with our fuel and decided that it was a great idea to go mine a moon to refuel. Not a good idea no, moons are really scary! Regardless, that waterfall was impressive, just imagine the size of the deposit it came from! We got what we needed and left. Another for the list!",

Our time is up! We are going back to Earth. I just kind of forgot what we saw during the Mission, which is a shame because I'm sure we had an awesome time. Hmm, if only I had a list of things to remember..."
