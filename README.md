# Mod Support
This mod has in-built support for other mods, like [Spawnable Item Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=733665104), [Wardrobe Interface](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=734855062), [Planet Search](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3269792617), [Book of Spirits](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3060280131), [Erisss' More Planet Info](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1117007107), [The Bookstore](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1108897518)/[Codex - A bookstore addon](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1109790315), and [Better Crew](https://community.playstarbound.com/resources/better-crew-and-npc-behavior.6190/); we are aiming for even more compatibily!

Here's also a couple of mod recommendations to play with that fit nice with Remnants: [Protectorate Themed Blocks](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=880170687) (and its [fix](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2840241429)), [Protectorate Furniture](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=732742952), either [Protector icons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=782825930) or [Starbound Patch Project](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1543219534) mostly for the icons (although I do recomend having both) and [Project Redemption](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1397217904) (as some parts of the Lore presented by Remnants were inspired by the additions of PR)
